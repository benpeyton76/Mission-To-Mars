# ***Mission To Mars***

## ***Overview:***
This project introduces the method of web scraping to extract online data for analysis. Web scraping is a technique used to automate tasks that would otherwise be time consuming and tedious. In order to use web scraping effectively, it is important to comprehend how to:
- Gain familiarity with and use HTML elements, as well as class and id attributes, to identify content for web scraping.
- Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and perform a web scrape.
- Create a MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape.
- Create a web application with Flask to display the data from the web scrape.
- Create an HTML/CSS portfolio to showcase projects.
- Use Bootstrap components to polish and customize the portfolio.

In this module, we will learn how to use these tools to create a web application that is dedicated to Mars, its environment, hemispeheres, and other pertinent scientific data.
